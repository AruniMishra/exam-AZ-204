## App Service Environment

- In the Isolated tier, the App Service Environment defines the number of isolated workers that run your apps, and each worker is charged. In addition, there's a flat Stamp Fee for the running the App Service Environment itself. Isolated: This tier runs dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.

- Specify custom warm-up
  - Some apps might require custom warm-up actions before the swap. The **applicationInitialization** configuration element in web.config lets you specify custom initialization actions. The swap operation waits for this custom warm-up to finish before swapping with the target slot. Here's a sample web.config fragment.
  
    ```xml
    <system.webServer>
        <applicationInitialization>
            <add initializationPage="/" hostName="[app hostname]" />
            <add initializationPage="/Home/About" hostName="[app hostname]" />
        </applicationInitialization>
    </system.webServer>
    ```

  - Auto-Swap is only available on Windows-based App Services
  - Requires at least a standard plan

- "use multiple containers in the same container group" this not is possible in windows.Solution is: Linux

  ```code
  -sku B1 --is-linux
  -deployment-container-image-name images.azurecr.io/website:v1.0.0
  -container set --docker-registry-server-url https://images.azurecr.io -u admin -p admin
  ```

- Within the same resource group, you can't mix Windows and Linux apps in the same region. However, all resource groups created on or after January 21, 2021 do support this scenario. For resource groups created before January 21, 2021, the ability to add mixed platform deployments will be rolled out across Azure regions (including National cloud regions) soon.

- Always On enables waking up on HTTPTrigger, but does not prevent the exceeding the max time out time of 230 seconds.

- If **WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE** setting is unspecified or set to false, the /home/ directory will not be shared across scale instances, and files written will not persist across restarts. Explicitly setting **WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE** to true will enable the mount. Once this is set to true, if you wish to disable the mount, you need to explicitly set **WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE** to false.

- **UseAzureAppConfiguration**: It enables your application to use the App Configuration middleware to handle the configuration updates for you automatically. No resart is needed.

## Vnet

- Key Vault references currently only support system-assigned managed identities. User-assigned

## Azure Function

- Triggers and bindings
  
  - Use an App Service plan. Configure the Function App to use an Azure Blob Storage trigger.
  Consumption plan can cause a 10-min delay in processing new blobs if a function app has gone idle. To avoid this latency, you can switch to an App Service plan with Always On enabled. [Azure Blob storage trigger for Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger?tabs=csharp)

  - If you require faster or more reliable blob processing, consider creating a queue message when you create the blob. Then use a **queue trigger** instead of a blob trigger to process the blob. Another option is to use **Event Grid**;
  
- When you create an Azure Functions trigger for Azure Cosmos DB, you select the container to connect, and the Azure Function gets triggered whenever there is a change in the container. Because Azure Functions uses the change feed processor behind the scenes, it automatically parallelizes change processing across your container's partitions.

### Durable function

- Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless compute environment. The extension lets you define stateful workflows by writing orchestrator functions and stateful entities by writing entity functions using the Azure Functions programming model. Behind the scenes, the extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you, allowing you to focus on your business logic.

## Storage account

- the change feed provides transaction logs of all the changes that occur to the blobs and the blob metadata in your storage account. The change feed provides ordered, guaranteed, a durable, immutable, read-only log of these changes. You can process these logs asynchronously, incrementally or in-full. If your application has to react to events much quicker than this, consider using Blob Storage events instead. Blob Storage Events provides real-time one-time events which enable your Azure Functions or applications to quickly react to changes that occur to a blob.

- The table api works for Azure Storage account and Cosmos DB.

- Azure Storage Client library for .NET
  - leaseTime is a TimeSpan representing the span of time for which to acquire the lease, which will be rounded down to seconds. If null, an infinite lease will be acquired. If not null, this must be 15 to 60 seconds
  - The BreakLeaseAsync method initiates an asynchronous operation that breaks the current lease on this container.

- "Only the hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level. The archive access tier can only be set at the blob level."

- The Azcopy tool can be used to copy data from one storage account to another. You can use the tool within automation scripts to ensure the data can be copied automatically.

## PowerShell

- Dockerfile sequence:
  
    FROM node:latest
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    COPY package.json .
    RUN npm install
    COPY . ./
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD [ “npm”, “start” ]

## Azure Cosmos DB

- Azure Cosmos DB offers five well-defined levels. From strongest to weakest, [the levels are](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels):
  - Strong
  - Bounded staleness
  - Session
  - Consistent prefix
  - Eventual

- For multi-region Cosmos accounts that are configured with a single-write region, enable automatic-failover by using Azure CLI or Azure portal. After you enable automatic failover, whenever there is a regional disaster, Cosmos DB will automatically failover your account.

- locations param
  - --locations : Add a location to the Cosmos DB database account.
    Usage: --locations KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]
    Required Keys: regionName, failoverPriority
    Optional Key: isZoneRedundant
    Default: single region account in the location of the specified resource group.
    Failover priority values are 0 for write regions and greater than 0 for read regions. A
    failover priority value must be unique and less than the total number of regions.
    Multiple locations can be specified by using more than one `--locations` argument.

- You can form a partition key by concatenating multiple property values into a single artificial partitionKey property. These keys are referred to as synthetic keys.
Another possible strategy to distribute the workload more evenly is to append a random number at the end of the partition key value. When you distribute items in this way, you can perform parallel write operations across partitions.

- In order to be an in-partition query, the query must have an ~equality filter~ that includes the partition key, a query that has a ~range filter~ on the partition key and won't be scoped to a single physical partition

## Virtual Machine

- Run scripts in your Windows
  
  - Custom Script Extension
    - The Custom Script Extension is primarily used for post deployment configuration and software installation.

  - Run command
    - The Run Command feature enables virtual machine and application management and troubleshooting using scripts, and is available even when the machine is not reachable, for example if the guest firewall doesn't have the RDP or SSH port open.

- You can store images in Azure Blob Storage.

- In order to grant VM access to ARM you need to:
  - assign VM user/system managed identity
  - configure permission to ARM for that identity
  - and then you can access token by Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet and use to to authenticate in ARM.

## Azure Blob storage

- Standard priority: The rehydration request will be processed in the order it was received and may take up to 15 hours.
- High priority: The rehydration request will be prioritized over Standard requests and may finish in under 1 hour for objects under ten GB in size.

## Azure Event Hub

- Azure Event Hubs enables you to automatically capture the streaming data in Event Hubs in an **Azure Blob storage** or **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 1 or Gen 2** account of your choice, with the added flexibility of specifying a time or size interval.

## Azure Active Directory

- MFA Enabled by conditional access policy. Multi-Factor Authentication comes as part of the following offerings:
  - Azure Active Directory Premium licenses - Full featured use of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Service (Cloud) or Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server (On-premises).
  - Multi-Factor Authentication for Office 365.
  - Azure Active Directory Global Administrators.

- To configure Manifest to include Group Claims in Auth Token
  1. Go to Azure Active Directory to configure the Manifest. Click on Azure Active Directory, and go to App registrations to find your application:
  2. Click on your application (or search for it if you have a lot of apps) and edit the Manifest by clicking on it.
  3. Locate the ג€groupMembershipClaimsג€ setting. Set its value to either ג€SecurityGroupג€ or ג€Allג€. To help you decide which:
      SecurityGroup - groups claim will contain the identifiers of all security groups of which the user is a member.
      All - groups claim will contain the identifiers of all security groups and all distribution lists of which the user is a member

- Permission:
  - Application Permissions: Your application needs to access the web API directly as itself (no user context). This type of permission requires administrator consent and is also not available for native client applications.
  - Delegation Permissions: Your application needs to access the web API as the signed-in user, but with access limited by the selected permission. This type of permission can be granted by a user unless the permission is configured as requiring administrator consent.

- Azure Active Directory Managed Service Identity (MSI) gives your code an automatically managed identity for authenticating to Azure services, so that you can keep credentials out of your code.
  - Note: Use the authentication-managed-identity policy to authenticate with a backend service using the managed identity. This policy essentially uses the managed identity to obtain an access token from Azure Active Directory for accessing the specified resource. After successfully obtaining the token, the policy will set the value of the token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.

  - There are two types of managed identities:

    - System-assigned Some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity an identity is created in Azure AD that is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.

    - User-assigned You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. In the case of user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.

- Azure Active Directory app manifest:
  - oauth2Permissions can only accept collections/array value
  - oauth2AllowImplicitFlow takes boolean value

## Key Vault

- Key Vault references will use the app's system assigned identity by default, but you can specify a user-assigned identity.

## api-management

- Add the validate-jwt policy to validate the OAuth token for every incoming request(validate-jwt for Open ID, API, secure authentication)

## Misc

Step 1: Create the Azure Functions app with a Premium plan type
Premium plan automatically scales based on demand using pre-warmed workers which run applications with no delay after being idle, runs on more powerful instances, and connects to virtual networks.

Step 2: Create a system-assigned managed identity for the application
When you enable a system-assigned managed identity an identity is created in Azure AD that is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. Key Vault references currently only support system-assigned managed identities. User-assigned identities cannot be used.

Step 3: Create an access policy in Key Vault for the application identity
Create an Access Policy in Key Vault for the application identity you created earlier. Enable the "Get" secret permission on this policy.
